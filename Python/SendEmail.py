#Note for Gmail Users, you need to generate an app password instead of your normal email password.
#This also requires enabling 2-step authentication.
#Follow the instructions here to set-up 2-Step Factor Authentication as well as 
#App Password Generation:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en/.
#Set-up 2 Factor Authentication, then create the App Password,
#choose Mail as the App and give it any name you want. This will output a 16 letter password for you. 
#Pass in this password as your login password for the smtp.
